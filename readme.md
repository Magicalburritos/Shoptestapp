## usage

my app was made with these things in mind it need to look neat for the user simple and easy to understand.
I made this with 3 screens one for a homepage one to search for a item and bring up the item with a small picture a description and price.
I used the product id to bring up a screen with a more indepth look and the item use a small amount of styling to make the items look pleasing to the eye.
finally add the screen to take advange of the user devices location and bring up near by deals.

navbar which takes you to one of these 3 options:

- homepage which shows the shop.com home page

- search which brings up products in a stack

- locals which allows the use of the devices location to be used
