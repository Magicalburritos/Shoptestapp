## usage

My app was made with these things in mind it needs to look neat simple and easy to understand.
I made this with 3 screens one for a homepage one to search for a item and bring up the item with a small picture a description and price.
I used the product id to bring up a screen with a more indepth look and the item use a small amount of styling to make the items look pleasing to the eye.
finally add the screen to take advange of the user devices location and bring up near by deals.

navbar which takes you to one of these 3 tab options:

- homepage (tab) which shows the shop.com home page

- search (tab) which allows the user to search for a product. then allows for the use to click on the item and bring up a stack of the item with product details

- locals (tab) which allows the use of the devices location to be used
